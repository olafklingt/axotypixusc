"A eXample Of a TinY PIano in elIXir USing SuperCollider"

the start of a example instrument using elixir and supercollider with a bad name so it will not get used.
its quite bad right now

on midi note 127 it dumps the note tree to the terminal

on midi note 57 it kills the server to show that the supervisor works

use it with:
mix deps.get; iex -S mix
